### Photo Pool
This is one of the main features of the application and one of the features for which the application was made. It allows the seamless sharing of photos among a group at the click of a button. This feature was designed keeping the users' convenience as the topmost priority and extensive study was done on the ergonomics of the UI, which was carefully crafted after many revisions.

### Travel Groups
Apart from easily being able to share media, users need a feature that will involve them further with each other by giving them a sense of shared collective belonging. Travel groups help achieve this. This brings us to the most important question - What is the difference between a regular social media group and a travel group? A regular group has no motive, and no longevity of conversation. The travel group is different from other social media groups in that it has a purpose, and the contents of a travel group are preserved for a long time because of its finite nature. Through a carefully designed experience, the groups and the associated memories together help the users capture moments in time which they will forever value and cherish.

### Memories
Like travel groups, memories help give the users a sense of shared collective belonging. The ability to comment and tag each other in photos within the groups is used as a tool to help the users seamlessly organize their involvement in group photos. They also appeal deeply to the human emotion of nostalgia, which greatly strengthens the user experience compared to regular social media groups.

### Trip Timeline
Trip timeline helps give a bird's eye view of the ongoing trip as well as past trips. Its value in the application is not merely an ornamental one, but one that helps change the users' experience towards travel. It serves as much more than an itinerary and organizes users' photos based on the location they were taken. Apart from that, it also gives the user suggestions for places they could visit in the future.

### Dynamic Recognition
The dynamic recognition is a subtle but highly efficient feature that aims to make the interaction between the application and the user seamless through the use of automatic detection of media whenever it is added in the gallery. This helps eliminate unnecessary gestures and interactions to greatly reduce the cognitive overload on the users.

With these well researched and extensively tested features in mind, the app aims to change the way travel experiences are perceived.
