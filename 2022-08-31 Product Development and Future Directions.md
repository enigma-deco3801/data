### Product Development
Given on the screen is our product development timeline (which resembles our *gantt* chart). We started off with a Lean approach and quickly came up with a Low-Fidelity prototype based on our problem statement. 

We got reviews on that and changed it accordingly. Now that we had a big picture view of what we had to build, we took advantage of our team's diverse skill set and branched off in different directions to cover the most ground in the shortest time:

- We started building the high-fidelity prototype for the app using Figma.
- Simultaneously, we researched extensively on the tools and stack we would use to build the app.
- We also conducted user research to know what functionality was more important to the users so that we could prioritize the features in our MVP.
- We started developing the functional prototype of the app derived from our high-fidelity prototype.
- We wrote tests for our code so that our codebase remains resilient to errors right from the beginning.

By the time we were done with these tasks, we had also achieved something significant. We had a fixed process which we could follow that yielded great results in a very short amount of time.

### Future Directions
Now that we have a fixed process to follow, we will shift towards the SCRUM approach in our subsequent sprints, which guarantees us more structure and more control over our deliverables and deadlines.

Every sprint will last approximately 2 weeks, by the end of which, all the code will be merged to yield a functioning deliverable.

All our goals will loosely resemble one of the four cycles we have defined for our development:

- **The Design Cycle** - 
- **The Frontend Cycle** - 
- **The Backend Cycle** - 
- **The DevOps Cycle** -
