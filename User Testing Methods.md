Developing a **robust user testing mechanism** strongly integrated into the app development process is essential to writing code that is actually relevant. It can have numerous benefits:
- **Constant feedback:** Through **heatmaps** and other user analytics techniques, we'll instantly know what is relevant, our development path will be streamlined, saving us *countless hours* of code.
- **Recruit user base from the beginning**: We won't have to go through the whole process of acquiring users for testing, we can just get the initial few and just work on our code and let the user base build in the background.
- We believe that what we're doing is instantly going in front of many users, hence it **keeps us motivated**.

### Approaches
- **Approach 1**: Let users download APKs
	- Easy, just build and share APK
	- Most people won't download the app and skip it
	- Getting test users to sign up will take a lot of effort

- **Approach 2** : Host our app demo on the internet
	- Hard to convert react native app to a browser demo
	- Most people would run through the demo by clicking the link
	- Very easy to sign up loads of test users
