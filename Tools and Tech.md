### Knowledge Management and Logging
Before starting anything, establishing a process to constantly gather information and data on everything, ranging from team meetings and brainstorming sessions to individual research and vital information on tools and techniques. We needed a system with which team members could:
- Effortlessly gather any kind of information at any time, including code, media, data etc.
- Share information amongst each other effortlessly, and collaborate with each other to organize that information and put it to use.
- Be able to make sense of data in an intuitive way.
- Keep track of the team's progress and be able to easily assign tasks without much communication.
After much research, we started using Obsidian as a knowledge management tool for our team. We linked it with GitHub so that it was available online to every team member. We logged everything from brainstorming sessions to code tutorials, and as a result, it became much easier to share and collaborate on large quantities of data in the team. This small practice paid off later to yield huge returns for the team as a whole.

### Research and Observation
Knowledge gained through extensive research is one of the cornerstones of our project. The initial specification document we were given at the beginning of the project was written in an open manner, which gave us the freedom of experimentation. One of the members of our team was well versed with UX Design and the psychology of design, which made the process of crafting a smooth overall interaction much easier. Our usual process was to divide the research between team members based on their existing expertise on the topics, then reading articles and journal entries on the same while combining it with their own observation to come up with potential solutions to a problem. The team members then noted down their ideas in the Obsidian and held meetings to build on them. Discussing ideas in this manner made sure that we were not wasting time on unnecessary meetings while also making sure that any ideas that we had were carefully vetted by the entire team.

### Prototyping
- Low-fidelity
- High-fidelity

### User Testing
- TAM & SUS
- Design Walkthrough and Co-design
- User Interviews (stage 1 & 2)
- Surveys
- Autoethnography

### App Development
After a brief discussions with the members of the team, React Native was decided to be the technology of choice for the development of our mobile app. This is because React Native has a large community of developers and a wide range of resources available, making it easy to get started and find help when needed. Also, almost all of our members were well versed in JavaScript and had used React and React Native to build mobile and web-applications in the past, so it was something that the team was comfortable using.
